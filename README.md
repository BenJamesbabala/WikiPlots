# WikiPlots

This repository holds the WikiPlot dataset, containing 116,945 story plots extracted from English language [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page). These stories are extracted from any English language article that contains a sub-header that contains the word "plot" (e.g., "Plot", "Plot Summary", etc.)

The *plots* file contains each story with one sentence per line. Each story is followed by <EOS> on a line by itself.

The *titles* file contains a list of articles in the story plots were found and extracted.

## wikiPlots.py

I have also included the Python script used to extract the story plots.

wikiPlots.py requires:
- An English Wikipedia dump
- [Wikiextractor](https://github.com/attardi/wikiextractor)

To use wikiPlots.py:

1. Download an [English Wikipedia dump](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/). From this link you fill find a file named something like "enwiki-20170401-pages-articles-multistream.xml.bz2". Make sure you download the .bz2 file that is **not** the index file.
2. Unzip the bz2 file to extract the .xml file.
3. Download [wikiextractor](https://github.com/attardi/wikiextractor). You do not need to set it up. Run it as follows:

``
python wikiextractor.py -o output_directory --json --html -s enwiki-...xml
``

You must run wikiextractor.py with these parameters. wikiPlots.py requires json files with nested html and with section header information preserved. Wikiextractor will produce a number of subfolders named "AA", "AB", "AC"... Within each folder will be a wiki_xx file containing a number of json records, one per article.

4. Run wikiPlots.py as follows:

``python wikiPlots.py wiki_dump_directory plot_file_name title_file_name``

`wiki_dump_director` should be the path to the directory containing the "AA", "AB", etc. folders. `plot_file_name` will be the name of the file that will contain the story plots. `title_file_name` will be the name of the file that will contain the list of story titles.
